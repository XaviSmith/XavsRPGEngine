v1.1
-Actions are now their own class rather than delegates, as it was a pain and ugly to add new types of actions. Made all associated changes to code
-Fighter stats (hp, mp, speed, attack, defence etc) now work like a "dictionary" by matching string names to their stats using GetStat() and SetStat(). This allows attacks to be set more easily (pass in what stats to check against each other by a string)
-TakeAction now uses IsAssignableFrom instead of IsSubclassOf
-TextMenuManager now does the work of advancing flavor text boxes etc. 
-BattlePositions are handled by a manager
-Every Fighter has a Basic Attack
-Every fighter has a unique ID.
-Removed the Struct "Option" in MenuOption script and moved its variables to MenuOption
-Players' skills are now dynamically populated at the beginning of their turn through MenuManager, rather than having been hardcoded
-MenuManager now handles switching to the menu to select target for an action
-Fighters are actually sorted by speed now
-Consolidated Removing Players and Enemies from the fight in FightManager.cs
-"[Name] went down!" and "Critical Hit!" are now displayed on taking down anyone in battle/landing a crit respectively
-Game Over text before transition
-Level up formulae now takes into account individual stat modifiers to customize levelling up (e.g. tanks can level up def 2x as high, but spAtk 0.3x)
-Tooltips for PlayerFighter's LevelUpModifiers, and Fighter.cs's Basic Attack variable.
-Consolidated Losing/Gaining hp and mana into UpdateHealth and UpdateMana respectively
-Stat modifiers stored in a list that gets reset at the end of every battle
-Fight Manager resets state after a battle + removes children
-Skills are learnt upon levelling up (NOTE: make sure they don't have the same script name!)
-All audio is now handled by an audio manager class with one source for music, and another for sound effects.
-Skill menu dynamically populates amount of cursor options as well.
-TextManager has been split into a DialogueManager and BattleTextManager
